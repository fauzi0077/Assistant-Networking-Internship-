## 🏢 Organization
**Company:** UDA Holdings Berhad  
**Department:** Group Information Technology Division  
**Location:** Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  
**Duration:** September 2021 – February 2022 (20 weeks)

---

## 🎯 Internship Objectives
- Understand real-world networking and IT infrastructure
- Gain hands-on experience with firewalls, switches, and VLANs
- Learn corporate IT workflows and documentation
- Improve communication and teamwork skills in a professional environment

---

## 🛠️ Key Responsibilities & Tasks

### 🔹 Networking & Infrastructure
- Assisted in configuring **VLANs** on switches  
- Assigned and managed **IP addresses** for network devices  
- Tested **RJ45 Ethernet cables** using network testers  
- Installed and configured **LAN cards**  
- Supported access point configuration and setup

### Network Switch Configuration

This image shows the **configuration of a network switch using the Command Line Interface (CLI)**.  
Through this configuration, the switch is set up to support proper network communication and segmentation.

The configuration process includes:
- Assigning **IP addresses** to switch interfaces
- Configuring **VLANs** to separate network traffic
- Setting **access and trunk ports**
- Defining interface status and parameters
- Verifying configurations using command outputs

Switch configuration via CLI allows precise control over network behavior and is commonly used in enterprise environments to ensure secure, stable, and efficient data transmission across the network.

### 🔹 Firewall & Security
- Installed and configured **pfSense firewall**
- Created **VLAN rules** and firewall policies
- Managed **Aliases** for blocking specific ports
- Performed firewall backup and password updates
- Learned firewall concepts and brand comparisons (Fortinet, pfSense)

### Install pfSense (Boot BIOS)

This step shows the process of installing **pfSense firewall** using the **BIOS boot method**.  
The system is configured to boot from a USB drive containing the pfSense installer, allowing the firewall operating system to be installed on the target machine. 
This setup is commonly used to deploy pfSense as a **network firewall and router** in enterprise environments.

### Default Keymap Configuration (pfSense)

This screen shows the **pfSense default console interface** after successful installation.  
The **default keymap** is used to ensure standard keyboard input without custom layout configuration.  

From this console menu, basic system settings can be managed, including:
- Assigning network interfaces (WAN / LAN)
- Configuring IP addresses
- Accessing shell and diagnostic tools
- Restarting or resetting pfSense services

Using the default keymap is recommended during initial setup to avoid input compatibility issues and to ensure a stable firewall configuration process.

### pfSense Web Interface (Dashboard)

This image shows the **pfSense web-based management interface**, also known as the **WebGUI Dashboard**.  
The dashboard provides an overview of system status, hardware information, and network configuration after successful firewall installation.

Through this interface, administrators can:
- Monitor system performance and resource usage
- Configure **firewall rules**, **NAT**, and **VLANs**
- Manage network interfaces (WAN / LAN)
- Configure VPN, services, and security settings
- Perform system updates and diagnostics

The pfSense WebGUI allows centralized and user-friendly management of the firewall, making it suitable for enterprise and corporate network environments.

### Firewall Aliases Configuration (pfSense)

This image shows the configuration of **Firewall Aliases** in pfSense, specifically for **port aliases**.  
Aliases are used to group multiple ports or services under a single name, making firewall rule management more efficient and easier to maintain.

In this configuration, commonly used service ports such as:
- Remote Desktop (3389)
- LDAP and LDAP over SSL
- Kerberos
- Skype and WhatsApp
- Desktop Central services

are grouped into aliases to allow centralized control.

Using aliases improves:
- Firewall rule readability
- Faster configuration changes
- Easier maintenance of security policies

This method is commonly applied in enterprise networks to simplify access control and port management.
